# Open Referral Tests

This repository contains some work-in-progress on exploring [creation of OpenReferral data packages](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral) using AirTable.

Goals

* Explore whether OpenReferral data spec can be modelled using AirTable;
* Use the AirTable API to pull out CSV files and turn them into a datapackage;
* Explore what can happen once we have an data package of OpenReferral data;

The process is generating learning which is going [into the OpenReferral issue tracker](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/issues).
